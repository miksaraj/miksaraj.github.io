title:  "Why F# is the best general programming language and why it's never going to become mainstream"

***F#*** is the best general programming
language so far developed. Period.
End of story. Every developer should
learn it and use it everywhere - because
let's face it, can you think of a use case
where F# is **not** the best tool for the
job? *No*? Yeah, I thought so as well...
<!--excerpt-->

Hold on, that's not strictly speaking true.
But at least I got your attention now, don't I?
Let's get a few of your counter arguments
answered and out of the way right away. First,
F# will not be competing with C on embedded
applications or kernel development - while
actually, F# is totally capable of dealing
with embedded surprisingly well. Second, F#
is not going to replace the plethora of shitty
JavaScript frontend frameworks out there any time soon,
since - let's face it: Fable sucks. But the
keyword here isn's specifity, it is **general**.
For most of the jobs out there, F# is technically
speaking a perfectly valid choice - whatever
it is, it can be done with F#, and in most
cases it can be done better with it.

"*If F# is so great, why don't I see it used more?*"
I hear you asking. We'll get to that. But first,
let's address what makes F# greater than 'Murica.

-- arguments for the greatness of F# come here --

-- then we address why devs don't use F# as much the lang deserves --

-- should every developer learn F# tho? --

... what's the point of learning new languages,
if you already know all you're going to write
at work is PHP? What do you gain from it? Why
be a PHP developer by day and an F# super hero
by night?
